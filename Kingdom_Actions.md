# Kingdom Actions

This document merges all Kingdom Actions into a single reference. Actions are grouped into their categories: Uphold Stability, Manage Armies, Expand the Borders, Urban Planning, Foreign Affairs, and General Economic Actions.

---

## 1. Uphold Stability
_Maintain the kingdom’s cohesion by resolving crises, supporting allies, and quelling unrest before it can take root._

### Coordinated Effort
_When two leaders form a partnership on a single action, their combined expertise ensures the best possible outcome._

**Limitations:**
- **Partnership:** Exactly TWO PCs may use Coordinated Effort together
- **Frequency:** May only be used ONCE per Kingdom Turn (one partnership total)
- **Other PCs:** May take any action independently, including the same action as the partnership (but without the coordination bonus)

**How it Works:**
- Two PCs declare they are using Coordinated Effort on a specific Kingdom Action
- Both participating PCs roll the skill check for that action with a +1 circumstance bonus
- Take the highest result between the two participants
- Other PCs may also choose the same action if they wish, but they roll independently without the +1 bonus

**Special Benefits:**
- No risk of failure for coordination itself
- The +1 bonus represents teamwork and shared knowledge 
- Creates a strategic choice: which action is most important to coordinate?

**Example:** PC1 and PC2 form a partnership to "Build Roads" using Coordinated Effort
- PC1 rolls Crafting: 1d20+8+1 = 16
- PC2 rolls Survival: 1d20+12+1 = 24  
- Result: The Build Roads action uses the 24 for their partnership
- PC3 could also choose "Build Roads" independently and would roll normally (without +1)
- PC4 could choose any action
- Only one Coordinated Effort partnership is allowed per turn
