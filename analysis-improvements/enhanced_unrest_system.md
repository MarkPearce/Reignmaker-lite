# Unrest Consequences

## Core Philosophy
Rather than making all actions harder through escalating penalties, unrest should create specific crises and consequences that demand attention. The penalty progression is gentler, but the narrative and mechanical consequences become increasingly severe.

## Unrest Tiers and Effects

### Tier 0: Stable (0-2 Unrest)
- **Penalty:** None
- **Incident Roll:** None
- **Description:** The kingdom is content and functioning normally

### Tier 1: Discontent (3-5 Unrest)
- **Penalty:** -1 to all kingdom checks
- **Incident Roll:** Roll d10 on Minor Incidents table each turn

### Tier 2: Turmoil (6-8 Unrest)
- **Penalty:** -2 to all kingdom checks
- **Incident Roll:** Roll d12 on Moderate Incidents table each turn

### Tier 3: Rebellion (9+ Unrest)
- **Penalty:** -3 to all kingdom checks (capped)
- **Incident Roll:** Roll d12 on Major Incidents table each turn

## Incident Roll Mechanics

### How Incident Rolls Work

**When:** At the start of each Kingdom Turn (Phase 2), after calculating current unrest tier

**Who Rolls:** The kingdom rolls on the appropriate incident table based on tier:
- **Tier 0 (0-2):** No roll
- **Tier 1 (3-5):** Roll d10 on Minor Incidents table
- **Tier 2 (6-8):** Roll d12 on Moderate Incidents table
- **Tier 3 (9+):** Roll d12 on Major Incidents table

**No Incident Results:**
- Each table includes "No Incident" entries (typically on 1-2)
- Represents tensions that don't escalate into crisis
- At higher tiers, additional incidents are guaranteed

**Modifying Incident Rolls:**
- **Justice Infrastructure:** Can spend to reroll incident die once per turn
  - T1 Stocks: Spend 1 Gold to reroll
  - T2 Jail: Reroll for free once per turn
  - T3 Prison: Reroll for free, +1 to roll
  - T4 Donjon: Reroll for free, +2 to roll
- **Cultural Infrastructure:** Modifies incident severity
  - T1 Open Stage: No effect
  - T2 Amphitheater: Treat one result as "No Incident" (3 becomes 1)
  - T3 Playhouse: Treat two results as "No Incident" (3-4 become 1-2)
  - T4 Auditorium: Prevent one incident per turn OR treat three results as "No Incident"

**Special:** The Auditorium (T4 Culture) can completely prevent one incident per turn instead of modifying the roll

### Incident Resolution

When an incident is rolled:

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Roll for Incident:** Determine which incident occurs
2. **Choose Approach:** Select which skill to use from the incident's options
3. **Make Skill Check:** One PC rolls using Level-based DC
4. **Apply Results:** Based on success/failure degree
5. **Track Ongoing:** Some incidents persist if not resolved

**Resolution Timing:**
- **Immediate:** Incident must be resolved this turn (uses 1 Kingdom Action)
- **Continuous:** Remains active until resolved (can attempt each turn)
- **Escalating:** Worsens each turn not addressed

**Modifiers to Incident Checks:**
- **Relevant Structures:** +1 to +4 based on tier of relevant skill structure
- **Multiple PCs:** Can use Coordinated Effort if available
- **Fame:** Spend 1 Fame to reroll the skill check
- **Auditorium:** Once per turn, auto-succeed one incident check

**Preventing Incidents:**
- **Roll "No Incident":** Natural result on table (25% chance at lower tiers)
- **Infrastructure:** Justice/Culture buildings can modify rolls
- **Auditorium (T4):** Can completely negate one incident per turn
- **Fame:** Spend 2 Fame to reroll the incident die

## New Rebellion Mechanics

### Rebellion Event
When triggered by unrest consequences:

**Initial Rebellion:**
- Rebels seize 1d3 hexes including at least 1 worksite
- Create rebel army (Level = Kingdom Level -2)
- Must be resolved within 3 turns or spreads

**Rebellion Spread (if not resolved):**
- Gains 1d3 additional hexes per turn
- 25% chance to gain another rebel army
- If rebels control a settlement, it declares independence

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Military:** Deploy armies to reclaim territory
2. **Diplomatic:** Negotiate (reduces some Unrest if successful)
3. **Concessions:** Grant autonomy (lose hexes but reduce Unrest)

### Secession Mechanics

When a settlement secedes:
- Settlement becomes independent city-state
- Takes all hexes within 2 spaces
- Forms defensive alliance with other secessionist settlements
- Can only be reclaimed through:
  - Military conquest (causes +2d4 Unrest)
  - Diplomatic reunification (requires Helpful attitude)
  - Waiting 10 turns for referendum option

## Morale Check Mechanics

Using the existing unsupported army rules as a template:

**Base Morale Check:**
- **DC:** Level-based DC for party level
- **Skill:** Diplomacy (inspire) or Intimidation (enforce)
- **Modifiers:**
  - -1 per tier of unrest above 1
  - +1 if army recently victorious
  - +1 if in fortified position
  - -2 if recently defeated

**Results:**
- **Critical Success:** Army rallies, -1 Unrest
- **Success:** Army remains loyal
- **Failure:** Army disbands peacefully, +1 Unrest
- **Critical Failure:** Army mutinies or turns bandit, +2 Unrest

## Implementation Notes

### Why This Works Better

1. **Lower Penalty Cap:** Maximum -3 instead of escalating forever
2. **Meaningful Choices:** Each tier introduces specific problems to solve
3. **Death Spiral Prevention:** Penalties cap while consequences escalate
4. **Narrative Drama:** Rebellions and secessions create story moments
5. **Strategic Depth:** Different consequences require different responses

### Balancing Passive Generation

With these consequences, the hex-based generation becomes more reasonable:
- **+1 per 8 hexes** creates real tension without being overwhelming
- **Metropolis +1** is significant but manageable
- Players must balance expansion with stability infrastructure

### Recovery Strategies

Different tiers require different approaches:
- **Tier 0:** No action needed - kingdom is stable
- **Tier 1:** Standard unrest management, preventive measures  
- **Tier 2:** Active crisis management, moderate incidents
- **Tier 3:** Emergency measures required, major incidents and possible territorial losses

## Example in Play

**Kingdom with 16 hexes and Metropolis:**
- Passive: +2 (hexes) +1 (Metropolis) = +3/turn
- Reaches Tier 1 (3 Unrest) by Turn 1
- Without management, hits Tier 2 (6 Unrest) by Turn 2
- Moderate incidents begin triggering - strikes, riots, disease
- By Turn 3: Reaches Tier 3 (9 Unrest) - rebellions now possible!
- Must balance dealing with consequences vs preventing escalation
- Imprisonment becomes critical to prevent unrest from spiraling out of control

## Recommended Adjustments

### For Hex-Based Generation:
- **Keep +1 per 8 hexes** with these new consequences
- **Keep Metropolis +1** as urban complexity cost
- **Add Relief Valve:** First Deal with Unrest action each turn at +2 bonus

### For Culture Buildings:
- **T1-T3:** Bonus to checks only
- **T4 Auditorium:** -1 Unrest/turn OR prevent one consequence/turn (player choice)

This creates a system where unrest truly threatens the kingdom through specific, escalating crises rather than just making everything harder to accomplish.
