- **Athletics** - No representation
- **Acrobatics** - No representation
- **Lore (general)** - No representation

## Key Observations

1. **Heavy Skew Toward Social Skills:** Diplomacy and Society dominate the action list
2. **Magic Skills Completely Absent:** No actions use Arcana or Occultism
3. **Physical Skills Underutilized:** Athletics and Acrobatics have no kingdom applications
4. **Knowledge Skills Limited:** General Lore has no use outside specialized versions
5. **Some Skills Only Appear Once:** Medicine, Stealth, Thievery are barely represented

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: Add Actions for Missing Core Skills
- Create actions that utilize Arcana and Occultism
- Add options for Athletics and Acrobatics
- Include general Lore as an alternative to specialized lores

### Priority 2: Balance Existing Actions
- Add alternative skill options to actions currently limited to 1-2 skills
- Reduce the dominance of Diplomacy by offering more varied approaches

### Priority 3: Create Thematic Groupings
- Ensure each "type" of character has meaningful options:
  - Warriors (Athletics, Intimidation)
  - Scholars (Lore, Arcana, Occultism)
  - Rogues (Stealth, Thievery, Deception)
  - Leaders (Diplomacy, Society, Performance)
  - Survivalists (Nature, Survival, Medicine)
  - Crafters (Crafting, Lore)
  - Faith-based (Religion, Medicine)

### Priority 4: Consider Action Variety
- Some actions should favor unusual skill combinations
- Create synergies between different character types
