# Kingdom Events Complete Audit

## Executive Summary

This audit examines all kingdom events for alignment with the game system, skill availability, and gameplay balance. The analysis reveals that while most events are well-designed and engaging, there are several critical issues that need addressing:

1. **Skill Misalignments**: Several events use skills that don't exist in the core system
2. **Structure Reference Issues**: Some events reference non-existent structure categories
3. **Balance Concerns**: A few events have disproportionate rewards or penalties
4. **Mechanical Clarity**: Some events lack clear progression mechanics

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix



## Moderate Issues

### 2. Structure Category Mismatches

Several events reference structure categories incorrectly or unclearly:

#### **Grand Coliseum Confusion**
- Listed in both **Military & Training** (skill structures) and **Culture** (support structures)
- Creates confusion about which structure provides which benefit
- **Fix**: Clarify that there are two different structures:
  - "Grand Coliseum" (Military & Training T4) - for earn income
  - "Grand Coliseum" (Culture T4) - for unrest reduction and fame

#### **Justice Structure References**
Events mention "Justice structures" but this category doesn't exist:
- **Execute or Pardon Prisoners** references Stocks, Jail, Prison, Donjon
- These appear to be missing from structure lists
- **Fix**: Add Justice category to support structures or clarify these are part of Civic & Governance

#### **Diplomatic Structure References**
- **Diplomatic Overture** mentions Embassy, Grand Embassy, Diplomatic Quarter
- These aren't in the structure lists provided
- **Fix**: Add these as Civic & Governance structures or create a Diplomacy category

## Balance Issues

### 3. Overpowered Rewards

#### **Land Rush Event**
- Can grant 2 free hexes on critical success
- No resource cost for expansion
- **Issue**: Normally claiming hexes requires actions and potential failures
- **Recommendation**: Reduce to 1 hex on critical success, or require some resource investment

#### **Magical Discovery Event**
- Critical success grants a FREE Tier 1 magical structure or upgrade
- **Issue**: This bypasses normal resource costs entirely
- **Recommendation**: Provide a discount (50% off) rather than free structure

### 4. Underpowered or Unclear Rewards

#### **Justice Prevails Event**
- Only provides unrest reduction
- No other tangible benefits
- **Recommendation**: Add Fame or Gold reward to make it more appealing

#### **Military Exercises Event**
- References "military kingdom actions" but these aren't clearly defined
- **Fix**: Specify exactly which actions benefit (Deploy Army, Outfit Army, etc.)

## Gameplay and Fun Factor Analysis

### Positive Design Elements ✓

1. **Meaningful Choices**: Most events offer 3+ skill approaches, allowing different character builds to contribute
2. **Risk/Reward Balance**: Critical failures have meaningful consequences without being game-ending
3. **Narrative Hooks**: Events like Cult Activity and Drug Den create ongoing storylines
4. **Progressive Challenges**: Continuous events that escalate create tension
5. **Structure Integration**: Many events reward infrastructure investment

### Areas for Improvement

#### **Repetitive Outcomes**
Many events follow the pattern:
- Critical Success: +Gold, -Unrest
- Success: +Gold OR -Unrest
- Failure: +Unrest
- Critical Failure: +2 Unrest

**Recommendation**: Diversify outcomes with:
- Temporary bonuses to specific actions
- Relationship changes with NPCs/factions
- Unlock special one-time actions
- Affect specific structures or settlements differently

#### **Limited Player Agency in Some Events**
Events like **Natural Disaster** feel purely punitive with no way to prepare or mitigate.

**Recommendation**: Add preparedness mechanics:
- Structures that reduce disaster severity
- Advance warning systems for some events
- Stockpiling resources to mitigate effects

## Missing Mechanical Clarity

### Events Needing Clarification

1. **Demand Expansion**
   - What happens if the kingdom has no adjacent unclaimed hexes?
   - Can this event trigger for island nations?

2. **Feud**
   - "Two settlements (if less than 2, no effect)" - should specify this event doesn't trigger with <2 settlements

3. **Food Shortage**
   - Can kingdoms with massive food storage use it to offset losses?
   - Interaction with Strategic Reserves unclear

4. **Cult Activity**
   - "First locate the cult, then defeat it" - needs clearer two-stage mechanics
   - Does it require two separate checks? Two successes?

5. **Raiders**
   - "Can pay 2 Gold tribute to immediately end" - should this require an action?

## Recommended New Events for Better Balance

### Add More Beneficial Events
Current ratio seems heavily weighted toward Dangerous events. Consider adding:
- **Trade Caravan**: Opportunity for bonus resources
- **Talented Artisan**: Temporary structure bonus
- **Bountiful Season**: Reduces all DCs by 1 for the turn

### Add More Skill Coverage
Underused skills in events:
- **Acrobatics**: Only in Grand Tournament and Military Exercises
- **Thievery**: Only in Sensational Crime, Infiltration, and one other
- **Occultism**: Underrepresented compared to Arcana and Religion

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Game-Breaking)
1. Fix skill references (Warfare Lore → Lore)
2. Clarify structure categories and references
3. Add missing Justice structures

### Medium Priority (Balance)
1. Adjust overpowered event rewards
2. Clarify continuous event mechanics
3. Add variety to event outcomes

### Low Priority (Enhancement)
1. Add new events for variety
2. Expand skill coverage
3. Create event chains and prerequisites

## Summary Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix all skill references to align with PF2e core skills
2. **Structure Clarity**: Create comprehensive structure list with clear categories
3. **Balance Pass**: Review and adjust rewards/penalties for outlier events
4. **Mechanical Documentation**: Add section explaining continuous events, multi-stage events
5. **Variety Enhancement**: Design 5-10 new events focusing on underused skills and beneficial outcomes

The event system shows strong foundational design with engaging narrative hooks and meaningful choices. With these adjustments, it will provide excellent gameplay variety while maintaining system consistency.
