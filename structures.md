# Skill-Based Structures

Skill-based structures follow a progression tied to settlement growth. Each structure category advances through four tiers, with each tier requiring specific settlement sizes: T1 (Village), T2 (Town), T3 (City), T4 (Metropolis). Job level for earn income scales predictably (Settlement Level +0/+2/+4/+6), as do circumstance bonuses to skill checks  (+0/+1/+2/+3), with Metropolis structures granting a reroll on one failed skill check per turn. Each structure begins supporting a single primary skill and expands to cover 2-3 related skills at higher tiers, creating natural upgrade paths within each category.
