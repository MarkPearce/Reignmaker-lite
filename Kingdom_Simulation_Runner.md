# Kingdom Simulation Runner for Reignmaker-lite

## Purpose
This document serves as a simulation runner for the Reignmaker-lite subsystem for pathfinder. Each time you run this simulation, it will:
1. Generate a unique 50-turn simulation with fresh dice rolls
2. Create a numbered output file (kingdom_simulation_001.md, _002.md, etc.)
3. Update the master analysis document with aggregated results

---

## ðŸŽ² RUN NEW SIMULATION

**To run a new simulation:**

1. **Check existing simulations** to determine the next number:
   - Look for files named `kingdom_simulation_###.md`
   - Use the next sequential number

2. **Generate a unique random seed:**
   - Use current timestamp: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
   - Or create a random d20 sequence (100-200 rolls)
   - Document the seed/sequence at the start of your simulation

3. **Create new simulation file:**
   - Filename: `kingdom_simulation_###.md` (e.g., kingdom_simulation_001.md)
   - Follow the structure and rules below
   - Use actual d20 rolls (not flat averages)

4. **Update master analysis:**
   - Add results to `kingdom_system_analysis.md`
   - Compare to previous simulations
   - Note any patterns or anomalies

## Initial Kingdom Setup

### Starting Conditions (Turn 0)
**Every simulation starts with these exact parameters:**

**Settlement:**
- 1 Village (Level 0)
- Located in a Plains hex (central position recommended)
- No starting structures

**Territory:**
- 3 controlled hexes total
- Recommended configuration:
  - 1 Plains hex (settlement location)
  - 1 Forest hex (adjacent)
  - 1 Hills hex (adjacent)

**Worksites:**
- Plains: None initially
- Forest: None initially
- Hills: None initially

**Resources:**
- Food: 0
- Gold: 0
- Lumber/Stone/Ore: 0 (cannot be stored initially)

**Military:**
- 0 armies (none recruited)

**Kingdom Status:**
- Unrest: 0
- Fame: 1
- Not at war

**Player Characters:**
- 4 PCs at Level 4 (starting level)
- Companions available for collective action
- 2 PCs with Expert proficiency (+11) in their primary skill
- 2 PCs with Trained proficiency (+8) in their primary skill

## Core Mechanics

### Kingdom Level = Party Level
The kingdom level advances in lockstep with the party level. They are the same number.

### DC Structure
**ALL kingdom actions use On-Level DCs:**
- Level 4: DC 19
- Level 5: DC 20
- Level 6: DC 22
- Level 7: DC 23
- Level 8: DC 24
- Level 9: DC 26
- Level 10: DC 27
- Level 11: DC 28
- Level 12: DC 30
- Level 13: DC 31
- Level 14: DC 32
- Level 15: DC 34

**No fixed DCs exist** - everything scales with kingdom/party level.

### Dice Resolution
**Use actual d20 rolls for each check:**
- Roll: 1d20 + modifier vs DC
- **Critical Success:** Beat DC by 10+ OR natural 20
- **Critical Failure:** Fail DC by 10+ OR natural 1
- **Success:** Meet or exceed DC (without critical)
- **Failure:** Below DC (without critical)

### PC Skill Progression
**Proficiency levels by party level:**
- **Levels 3-6:** 2 PCs have Expert, 2 PCs have Trained
- **Levels 7-14:** 2 PCs have Master, 2 PCs have Expert
- **Levels 15+:** 2 PCs have Legendary, 2 PCs have Master

**Modifiers (assuming +4 ability):**
- Trained: Level + 6
- Expert: Level + 8
- Master: Level + 10
- Legendary: Level + 12

## Turn Structure

Each turn follows these 6 phases:

### Phase 1: Gain Fame
- Gain 1 Fame (if not at max)
- Note available Fame for rerolls

### Phase 2: Apply Modifiers
- Check if at war (+1 Unrest if yes)
- Apply structure bonuses
- Calculate Unrest penalty (-1 per 5 Unrest)

### Phase 3: Kingdom Event Check
- Start at DC 16
- Reduce by 5 each turn without event
- Reset to DC 16 after event occurs
- Roll d20 vs DC

### Phase 4: Resource Management
- Calculate production from all worksites
- Subtract consumption (settlements + armies)
- Apply storage limits
- Process construction projects

### Phase 5: Kingdom Actions
- Each PC takes one action
- Companions take one collective action
- Apply all modifiers and roll d20 for each
- Record actual roll, modifier, total, and result type

### Phase 6: End of Turn
- Update all kingdom statistics
- Check for milestone achievements
- Note any special conditions

- Build Theater/cultural structures
- Avoid critical failures

**Food Shortage:**
- Build more Farmsteads
- Trade for food
- Reduce army size

**Expansion Stall:**
- Wait for Master proficiency (Level 7)
- Use Coordinated Actions
- Focus on other growth

**Gold Shortage:**
- Build economic structures
- Focus on Trade actions
- Develop settlements for taxes

---

## Notes

- Each simulation should use UNIQUE randomization
- Document any house rules or interpretations
- Note any software/tools used for dice rolling
- Keep the narrative engaging but accurate
- Focus on demonstrating the rules in action

**Remember:** The goal is to test whether the kingdom rules consistently produce balanced, enjoyable gameplay across multiple unique simulations.
