# Unrest Incident Tables

This document contains the incident tables for the unrest system. When unrest reaches certain tiers, roll on the appropriate table to determine what crisis occurs in your kingdom. Each incident is a skill-based event that requires resolution using Level-based DC for all checks.

For the complete unrest system mechanics, including tiers, effects, and how incident rolls work, see the **Unrest** section in **Kingdom_Rules.md**.
