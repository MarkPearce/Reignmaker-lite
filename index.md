# Reignmaker

Welcome to Reignmaker, a kingdom-building system for Pathfinder 2e. This ruleset lets you and your party build, develop, and manage your own kingdom through collaborative storytelling and strategic decision-making.

**Your Character, Your Kingdom:** Each PC uses their personal skills to influence the kingdom. A skilled diplomat negotiates treaties, a master craftsperson oversees construction, and a charismatic leader rallies troops—your character's abilities directly shape your realm.

**Turn-Based Development:** Kingdom turns represent periods of focused governance. Each turn, your PCs each take one Kingdom Action to develop the realm. These actions use skill checks against level-based DCs, following Pathfinder 2e's standard proficiency and degree of success system.

**Meaningful Consequences:** Success brings prosperity—new settlements, loyal armies, and diplomatic alliances. Failure brings challenges—unrest, incidents, and crises that demand attention. Your choices matter, and the kingdom responds to both triumphs and setbacks.

## Turn Structure

Each Kingdom Turn follows 6 phases:
1. **Status Phase** - Gain Fame, apply permanent modifiers
2. **Resource Phase** - Collect resources and gold
3. **Unrest & Incidents Phase** - Calculate unrest, check for incidents
4. **Events Phase** - Check for random kingdom events
5. **Action Phase** - Each PC takes one Kingdom Action (4 total)
6. **Upkeep Phase** - Food consumption, military support, build queue, end-of-turn resolution

## Getting Started

**For First-Time Kingdom Builders:**
1. Read the **[Turn Order](Turns/index.md)** to understand the 6 phases of a kingdom turn
2. Review **[Resources](Resources.md)** to learn about food, lumber, stone, ore, and gold
3. Explore **[Settlements](settlements/index.md)** to understand villages, towns, cities, and metropolises
4. Browse the **[Actions](Actions.md)** to see what your PCs can do each turn
5. Study the **[Turn Example](Turns/Turn_Example.md)** to see everything work together
6. Use the **[Stat Block](Stat_Block.md)** to track your kingdom's statistics

**Key Concepts:**
- **Fame:** Reputation points that let you reroll kingdom checks (use it or lose it each turn)
- **Resources:** Materials you collect and spend to build your kingdom
- **Unrest:** Disorder that triggers incidents when it gets too high
- **Actions:** Each PC takes one per turn to shape the kingdom

**Note:** These rules are designed to integrate seamlessly with Pathfinder 2e. All skill checks use the standard PF2e proficiency system, and kingdom actions follow the four degrees of success (Critical Success, Success, Failure, Critical Failure).
