# Example Kingdom Turn

**Kingdom:** 1 Town (Level 3, needs 4 Food)
**Controlled hexes:**
- 2x Plains with Farmsteads = 4 Food
- 1x Forest with Logging Camp = 2 Lumber
- 1x Hills with Quarry = 1 Stone
- Total: 4 hexes (no territory unrest)

## Turn Sequence:

**Phase 1 – Gain Fame:** 
- Gain 1 Fame automatically
- Current Fame: 1 (can spend to reroll kingdom checks)

**Phase 2 – Apply Ongoing Modifiers & Check for Incidents:** 
- Not at war (no unrest penalty)
- Territory: 4 hexes (no passive unrest)
- Current Unrest: 2 (Tier 0: Stable - no penalty, no incident check)
- No special structure bonuses active

**Phase 3 – Check for Kingdom Events:** 
- Roll flat check DC 16: Rolled 14 (failure)
- No event this turn; DC drops to 11 for next turn

**Phase 4 – Manage Resources:**
- **Production:** 4 Food, 2 Lumber, 1 Stone
- **Food Consumption:** Town consumes 4 Food → balanced (no shortage/unrest)
- **Military Support:** 1 army active, Town supports 2 armies → no morale check needed
- **Construction Queue:** Building a Training Yard (costs 2 Lumber, 2 Stone total)
  - Apply 2 Lumber + 1 Stone this turn automatically
  - 1 Stone still needed to complete (will finish next turn)
- **Storage:** No Storehouses built → excess Lumber/Stone/Ore lost at end of turn
- **Gold:** No income this turn (no commerce structures)

**Phase 5 – Perform Kingdom Actions (4 PCs, 4 actions):**
- PC 1: **Develop Settlement** to add a Market Square (rolls success)
- PC 2: **Deal with Unrest** using Diplomacy (rolls success, -1 Unrest)
- PC 3: **Send Scouts** to explore eastern hex (rolls success)
- PC 4: **Build Worksite** (Farmstead) in explored hex (rolls failure)

**Phase 6 – Upkeep:**
- Unrest reduced to 1 (from the Deal with Unrest action)
- No lingering event effects
- Unused Lumber/Stone/Ore lost (no storage capacity)
- Gold balance remains at 3 (carried over)
- Training Yard will complete next turn when final Stone is produced

**Result:** Kingdom stable, construction progressing, Market Square added, eastern hex scouted, worksite attempt failed.
