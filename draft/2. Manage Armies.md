# 2. Manage Armies
_War must be waged with steel and strategy. Take command of your forces and ensure your enemies fall before your banners._

An **Army** consists of up to four **units**. Your kingdom can support units based on settlements (per settlement):

*   **Village**: 1 units
    
*   **Town**: 2 units
    
*   **City**: 3 units
    
*   **Metropolis**: 4 units
    

Each army can only take **one action per turn**.

### **Recruit a Unit** #

_Begin the muster. Whether drawn by patriotism, coin, or fear, new recruits swell your ranks._

**Skill:** @Check\[type:Diplomacy\] or @Check\[type:Intimidation\] or @Check\[type:Society\]

To recruit a **Unique Unit**, you must have diplomatic relations with the nation and that nation must have availability.
