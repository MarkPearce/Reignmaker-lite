# Overview
### Purpose

These rules are a streamlined version of the Kingdom Rules for use in the Kingmaker module. The goals are to provide compelling decisions and simulate managing and growing a kingdom while simplifying the rules.

### The Kingdom Turn

The Kingdom Turn resolves in the following order:

1.  **Gain Fame**
2.  **Determine Kingdom Event**
3.  **Collect Resources & Pay Upkeep
4.  **Perform Kingdom Actions**

#### 1\. Gain Fame and adjust unrest

*   **At** the beginning of the turn, your kingdom starts with 1 Fame point. Any character can use this to reroll a kingdom roll. Hero points cannot be used on kingdom rolls.
*   **Whenever** you roll a critical success on a kingdom roll, your kingdom gains 1 Fame point, up to a maximum of 3.
*  If your kingdom is at **war**, add 1 to your Unrest. Ongoing kingdom events may also affect unrest. 
* Every five unrest induces a -1 status penalty to all kingdom rolls 
  (0 - 5 = -1 | 6 - 10 = -2 | 11-15 = -3 etc)

#### 2\. Determine Kingdom Event

[[Appendix 2c\_ Kingdom Events|Appendix 2c: Kingdom Events]]

*   **At** the beginning of the turn, roll a DC 16 flat check. On a success, a random kingdom event occurs.
*   **Each** time this flat check fails, the DC for the next turn is reduced by 5.
*   **Once** a kingdom event occurs, the DC resets to 16.

#### 3\.Collect Resources & Pay Upkeep

our kingdom economy and facilities system fits here.
#### 4. Perform Kingdom Actions

[[Kingdom Actions]]

*   **Players** resolve actions to manage the kingdom, it's armies, and it's settlements.
*   Actions are separated into 5 main categories.
    
*   Each PC takes **one Kingdom Action** per Kingdom Turn, if you have companions, they also take a collective action. These actions represent the influence of that character on the larger political, military, or social landscape of the realm.
*   Skill checks use **Level-Based DCs** _(using the Party Level)_ modified as appropriate to the situation.
    
*   If taken from the **Capital**, the action gains a **+1 Circumstance Bonus**.
    
*   Actions marked with **#** may only be taken **once per Kingdom Turn**.
    
*   **Before** resolving any action, all players decide what they will be doing, skill checks are then rolled.
