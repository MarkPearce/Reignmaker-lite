# Support Structures

Support structures provide essential infrastructure for kingdom management, from basic storage and defense to sophisticated commerce and cultural institutions. Each category serves a specific role in maintaining and growing your realm.

## Food Storage

Food storage facilities preserve your kingdom's agricultural surplus, protecting against famine and enabling population growth. Higher-tier facilities offer greater capacity and special protective measures.

## Fortifications

Fortifications protect settlements from invaders and provide defensive bonuses to armies stationed within. More advanced fortifications increase the effective level of defending forces (max party level) and provide strategic advantages during sieges.
