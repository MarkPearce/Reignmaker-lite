## Analysis Notes

### What Worked Well
1. **Early Infrastructure:** Building Farmsteads and Granaries early prevented food crises
2. **Unrest Management:** Theater and Arena provided consistent Unrest reduction
3. **Economic Development:** Marketplace → Grand Market → Trade Networks created strong economy
4. **Military Balance:** Maintaining 3-5 armies was sufficient for most threats
5. **Critical Success Timing:** Critical successes at key moments (Dragon fight, development) accelerated growth

### Challenges Faced
1. **Turn 11 Disease:** Required immediate response but was manageable
2. **Storage Caps:** Repeatedly hit Food storage limits until more Granaries built
3. **Level 6-8 Transition:** Proficiency increase at Turn 11 was crucial for continued success
4. **Resource Balance:** Lumber and Stone less critical than Food and Gold

### Strategic Insights
1. **Action Priority:** Development > Infrastructure > Military > Exploration
2. **Sweet Spot:** City Level 5-6 with 20-25 hexes appears optimal for balance
3. **Fame Usage:** Rarely needed rerolls due to high bonuses from structures
4. **Event Management:** Most events manageable with prepared responses

### Rules Observations
1. **DC Scaling:** On-level DCs with proficiency scaling creates consistent 60-70% success rate
2. **Critical Success Rate:** ~10-15% creates exciting moments without breaking balance
3. **Resource System:** Food management is primary concern, Gold accumulates steadily
4. **Settlement Growth:** Levels 0-5 smooth, 6-8 require focused effort, 9+ very difficult

### Comparison to Expected Milestones
- **Turn 10:** Exceeded (City vs Town expected)
- **Turn 20:** Far exceeded (Metropolis vs Town expected)
- **Turn 30:** On target (24 hexes vs 20-25 expected)
- **Turn 40:** Slightly below (Level 6 vs 7 expected)
- **Turn 50:** Below target (Level 6 vs 8+ expected, 24 vs 25-30 hexes)

*Note: The simulation showed strong early growth that plateaued in later turns, suggesting the system may need adjustment for Levels 13-15 progression rates.*

---

## Recommendations for System Adjustments

1. **Late Game Progression:** Consider reducing DC scaling at higher levels or providing more bonuses
2. **Storage Scaling:** Granaries become mandatory - perhaps allow some base storage increase with settlement level
3. **Military Costs:** Army food consumption is manageable but limits expansion
4. **Event Frequency:** Current system (DC reduction over time) works well
5. **Critical Success Rewards:** Very impactful - perhaps too strong for development actions
