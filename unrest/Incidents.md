# Incidents

When unrest in the kingdom, exceeds the stable range (>2) Roll an incident check. The likelihood of an incident occurring increases depending upon the tier level of unrest. 80% chance with discontent, 85% chance with turmoil, and 90% chance in rebellion.  If an incident occurs roll randomly on the appropriate table to determine what crisis occurs in your kingdom. Each incident is a skill-based event that requires resolution using Level-based DC for all checks. Although they require a skill check, they do not count as a player's action. Incidents are never positive, but a critical success in resolution will still grant fame.
