## Strategic Analysis

### What Worked Well
1. **Early Trade Success:** Critical success on Turn 4 trade provided crucial resources
2. **Town to City Jump:** Critical success on Turn 13 accelerated growth
3. **Marketplace + Trade Routes:** Economic foundation proved vital
4. **Theater:** Passive -1 unrest/turn was essential for stability
5. **Diplomatic Structures:** Embassy and Grand Embassy prevented worse crises

### Challenges Faced
1. **No Companions:** Lost 20% of action economy made everything harder
2. **Early Food Crisis:** Town consumption without adequate production
3. **Territory Unrest:** Hitting 16+ and 24+ hex thresholds added pressure
4. **Incident Frequency:** Without Companions, fewer actions to handle incidents
5. **Prison Break:** Turn 46 released all imprisoned unrest at once

### Critical Turning Points
1. **Turn 4:** Trade critical success prevented early collapse
2. **Turn 13:** City achievement provided crucial structure slots
3. **Turn 32:** Metropolis achievement despite rising unrest
4. **Turn 29:** Arrest Dissidents prevented unrest spiral
5. **Turn 46:** Prison Break nearly caused kingdom collapse

### Rules Observations
- Removing Companions makes the game noticeably harder but still winnable
- 4 actions per turn creates meaningful prioritization decisions
- Incidents feel more threatening when action economy is limited
- The Theater becomes even more essential without extra actions
- Success requires more careful planning and risk management

## Conclusion

The simulation demonstrated a **Standard Success** despite the removal of Companion actions. The kingdom grew from a village to a Metropolis controlling 22 hexes while managing 21 different incidents. The reduced action economy (4 actions instead of 5) made the game noticeably more challenging, requiring careful prioritization between growth, stability, and crisis management.

Key lesson: Without Companions, kingdoms must be more conservative with expansion and invest earlier in stability infrastructure. The loss of that fifth action significantly impacts flexibility in responding to crises while maintaining growth momentum. Success is still achievable but requires tighter resource management and strategic planning.
