# Kingdom Simulation #004 - Summary

**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Rule Variants:** 
- Correct Pathfinder 2e critical rules (fail/succeed by 10+ only)
- Selective failure consequences (crisis/military actions only)
**Result:** Standard Success

## Quick Stats
- Final Settlement: Metropolis Level 9
- Territory: 28 hexes
- Gold: 89
- Armies: 3
- Maximum Unrest: 4

## Comparison Across All Simulations

### Simulation #002 (Original Rules - No Failure Consequences)
- **Result:** Metropolis Level 10
- **Max Unrest:** 4
- **Gold:** 127
- **Problem:** Too easy - succeeded despite 40% success rate

### Simulation #003 (All Failures Cause Unrest)
- **Result:** COLLAPSE Turn 11
- **Max Unrest:** 12
- **Gold:** ~2
- **Problem:** Impossible - death spiral inevitable

### Simulation #004 (Selective Consequences)
- **Result:** Metropolis Level 9
- **Max Unrest:** 4
- **Gold:** 89
- **Verdict:** BALANCED

## Critical Rule Corrections Impact

### Pathfinder 2e Actual Rules:
- **Critical Success:** Beat DC by 10+ (NOT natural 20)
- **Critical Failure:** Fail DC by 10+ (NOT natural 1)

### Early Game Critical Failure Rates (Level 4, DC 19):
- **Expert (+11):** Rolls 1-7 = 35% critical failure rate!
- **Trained (+8):** Only roll 1 = 5% critical failure rate
- **Companions (+6):** Rolls 1-3 = 15% critical failure rate

This creates significant early game tension without being overwhelming.

## Recommended Failure Consequence System

### Actions that cause +1 Unrest on Critical Failure:
1. **Crisis Response:**
   - Resolve Kingdom Event
   - Deal with Unrest
   - Execute/Pardon Prisoners

2. **Military Operations:**
   - Recruit Army
   - Deploy Army
   - Disband Army

3. **Public Order:**
   - Arrest Dissidents

### Actions with NO unrest consequences:
- All development actions (Claim Hex, Build Structure, etc.)
- Economic actions (Trade, Create Worksite, etc.)
- Infrastructure (Build Roads, Upgrade Settlement, etc.)

**Result:** ~30% of action types can cause unrest, preventing death spirals while maintaining tension.

## Key Turning Points

1. **Turn 1:** Critical success on farm creation - strong start
2. **Turn 6:** Town achieved on schedule
3. **Turn 9:** First crisis from military critical failure
4. **Turn 23:** Master proficiency unlocked - expansion accelerates
5. **Turn 28:** City achieved slightly ahead of schedule
6. **Turn 44:** Metropolis achieved

## Strategic Insights

### What Works:
- **Selective Consequences:** Players can attempt development without fear
- **Crisis Actions Matter:** Military and event failures still dangerous
- **Recovery Possible:** Bad streaks don't doom kingdoms
- **Progression Curve:** Steady advancement with occasional setbacks

### Balance Achievement:
- Maintains ~60% overall success rate
- Unrest averages 2-3 (manageable)
- Critical failures create drama without spirals
- Multiple paths to recovery exist

## Final Assessment

Simulation #004 proves that with:
1. Correct Pathfinder 2e critical rules (10+ differential)
2. Selective failure consequences (~30% of actions)
3. Proper DC scaling (on-level DCs)

The kingdom system creates engaging, balanced gameplay where:
- Success is achievable but not guaranteed
- Failures have meaningful but not catastrophic consequences
- Strategic choices matter more than lucky rolls
- Recovery from setbacks is possible but requires focus

**This represents the optimal balance point for the Reignmaker-lite kingdom rules.**
