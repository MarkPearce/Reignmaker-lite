## Strategic Analysis

### What Worked Well
1. **Early Food Security:** Building multiple Farmsteads prevented sustained shortages
2. **Timely City Advancement:** Critical success on Turn 9 jumped settlement growth
3. **Incident Management:** Temple and Theater reduced incident frequency/severity
4. **Economic Foundation:** Marketplace and trade routes provided financial flexibility
5. **Arrest Dissidents:** Converting unrest to imprisoned proved crucial in mid-game

### Challenges Faced
1. **Territory Expansion vs Unrest:** Each threshold increased passive unrest
2. **Metropolis Burden:** Additional +1 unrest/turn added pressure
3. **Food Consumption:** City/Metropolis food needs required constant attention
4. **Incident Cascades:** Tier 2 incidents often created additional problems
5. **Military Costs:** Supporting 5 armies strained food supplies

### Critical Turning Points
1. **Turn 9:** City achievement provided structure slots for growth
2. **Turn 23:** Entering Turmoil tier marked increased incident severity
3. **Turn 28:** Metropolis achievement despite infrastructure damage
4. **Turn 34:** Arrest Dissidents prevented unrest spiral
5. **Turn 44:** Guerrilla Movement nearly caused territorial collapse

### Rules Observations
- The new unrest tier system creates meaningful decision points
- Incident resolution without consuming actions maintains gameplay flow
- Passive unrest from territory creates natural growth tension
- Selective critical failure penalties feel more balanced
- The Theater's passive -1 unrest/turn proved essential for stability

## Conclusion

The simulation demonstrated a **Standard Success**, achieving City status, maintaining reasonable unrest levels, and accumulating sufficient resources while managing numerous incidents. The kingdom grew from a small village to a sprawling metropolis controlling 24 hexes, though constant vigilance was required to prevent collapse during crisis periods.

The updated unrest system with tier-based incidents created engaging narrative moments without making the game unwinnable. The balance between growth and stability felt challenging but fair, with multiple viable strategies for managing unrest (Deal with Unrest, Arrest Dissidents, structures, incident resolution).

Key lesson: Success requires balancing aggressive expansion with unrest management infrastructure. The passive unrest from territory and metropolises means kingdoms must invest in stability alongside growth.
