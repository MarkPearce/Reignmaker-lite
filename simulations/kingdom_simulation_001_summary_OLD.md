# Kingdom Simulation #001 - Summary

**Date:** September 16, 2025  
**Result:** Standard Success

## Quick Stats
- Final Settlement: Metropolis Level 10
- Territory: 24 hexes
- Gold: 72
- Armies: 5
- Final Unrest: 7 (Tier 2: Turmoil)

## Growth Trajectory
- **Early Game (Turns 1-10):** Village to City - Rapid initial growth
- **Expansion Phase (Turns 11-20):** Reached 12 hexes, built infrastructure
- **Consolidation (Turns 21-30):** Achieved Metropolis status
- **Crisis Management (Turns 31-40):** Handled Tier 2 incidents
- **Final Challenge (Turns 41-50):** Survived major rebellions

## Unrest Management
- Maximum Unrest: 8 (Turn 44, Tier 2)
- Incidents Faced: 18 total
  - Minor: 8
  - Moderate: 7  
  - Major: 3
- Crisis Points: Tier changes at Turns 10, 23, 31
- Average Unrest: 4.2 (well-controlled)

## Critical Moments

### Game-Changing Successes
1. **Turn 9:** Critical success advanced Town directly to City (+1 Fame)
2. **Turn 7:** Monster defeated with critical success (+2 Fame)
3. **Turn 42:** Economic reform critical prevented total collapse

### Major Setbacks
1. **Turn 44:** Guerrilla Movement seized 2 hexes
2. **Turn 18:** Emigration Threat lost a worksite permanently
3. **Turn 46:** Prison Break released imprisoned unrest

## Key Turning Points
1. **Turn 9:** Early City achievement unlocked growth potential
2. **Turn 28:** Metropolis reached despite infrastructure damage
3. **Turn 34:** Arrest Dissidents prevented unrest spiral
4. **Turn 44:** Guerrilla rebellion nearly caused collapse
5. **Turn 50:** Final diplomacy maintained kingdom unity

## Strategic Insights
- **What Worked:** Multiple Farmsteads early, Temple/Theater for incident reduction, Arrest Dissidents for crisis management
- **Challenges:** Balancing territory expansion with unrest, managing City/Metropolis food needs, incident cascades in Tier 2
- **Sweet Spot:** 9-12 hexes with City status provided best growth/stability ratio

## Final Assessment
The kingdom achieved a Standard Success, growing from a single village to a sprawling Metropolis controlling 24 hexes. The simulation demonstrated that the new unrest tier system with incidents creates engaging challenges without becoming unwinnable. Success required careful balance between aggressive expansion and investment in stability infrastructure. The passive unrest from territory size and the Metropolis burden meant constant attention to unrest management was essential throughout.
