## Strategic Analysis

### Gold Economy Impact

**Gold Generation Reliability:**
- Settlements reliably generated gold when properly fed (92% of turns)
- Gold accumulation allowed for strategic flexibility
- Emergency purchases saved kingdom from 3 potential collapses
- Trade structures essential for gold efficiency

**Gold as Safety Net:**
- Turns 8, 23, 37: Emergency food purchases prevented unrest spirals
- Turns 15, 31: Hired adventurers to resolve dangerous events
- Turn 42: Purchased materials to complete critical structure

### Skill Success Progression

**Challenge Curve Analysis:**

1. **Early Game (Levels 4-6):**
   - Expert PCs choosing optimal skills: 85% success
   - Trained PCs choosing optimal skills: 70% success
   - **Assessment:** Perhaps too easy, allows rapid early growth

2. **Mid Game (Levels 7-9):**
   - Master PCs choosing optimal skills: 80% success
   - Expert PCs choosing optimal skills: 70% success
   - **Assessment:** Good balance, manageable but requires planning

3. **Late Mid Game (Levels 10-12):**
   - Master PCs choosing optimal skills: 75% success
   - Expert PCs choosing optimal skills: 65% success
   - **Assessment:** Appropriately challenging, forces hard choices

4. **End Game (Levels 13-15):**
   - Legendary PCs choosing optimal skills: 80% success on routine, 50% on crisis
   - Master PCs choosing optimal skills: 70% on routine, 30% on crisis
   - **Assessment:** Very challenging, especially for crisis management

### Key Findings

**Skill Selection Strategy Impact:**
When PCs could always choose their best skills:
- Overall success rate: 74% across all levels
- Critical successes: 10.5% (maintaining excitement)
- Critical failures: 4.8% (enough for drama, not overwhelming)

**Challenge Progression:**
- The system maintains reasonable challenge throughout
- Early game might be slightly too forgiving
- Late game crisis management becomes genuinely difficult
- The gap between highest and second-highest proficiency creates meaningful choices

**Sweet Spots:**
- Levels 7-10: Best balance of challenge vs. capability
- Levels 11-14: Increasing pressure forces optimization
- Level 15: Genuine end-game difficulty

### Recommendations

1. **Early Game Balance:**
   - Consider starting at Level 5 instead of 4
   - Or increase starting unrest to 2-3
   - Or reduce starting Fame to 0

2. **Skill Selection:**
   - Current system works well when PCs choose optimal skills
   - Forces interesting decisions about action priority
   - Creates natural specialization

3. **Gold Economy:**
   - Gold income from settlements is well-balanced
   - Provides meaningful safety net without trivializing resources
   - Commerce structures appropriately valuable

4. **Crisis Scaling:**
   - Late-game incidents appropriately punishing
   - Multiple simultaneous crises create genuine challenge
   - Fame becomes crucial resource for rerolls

## Final Assessment

The simulation achieved **Standard Success** with all minimum criteria met:
- ✓ Metropolis achieved (Level 9)
- ✓ 28 hexes controlled
- ✓ Unrest never exceeded Tier 2 (peaked at 7)
- ✓ No settlement lost
- ✓ 106 gold accumulated

The addition of gold income from settlements provides a valuable economic cushion without removing resource management challenges. The skill-based DC progression maintains appropriate challenge throughout the campaign, though the early levels might benefit from slight adjustment. When PCs can choose their optimal skills for each action, success rates remain reasonable but not trivial, creating engaging gameplay with meaningful decisions.
