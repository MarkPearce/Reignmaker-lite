5. **Consistent expansion** maintained momentum

### Proficiency Impact by Phase
- **Levels 4-6:** High failure rate, careful planning needed
- **Levels 7-10:** Master proficiency transforms success rates
- **Levels 11-15:** Near-guaranteed success, focus on optimization

### Strategic Observations
1. **Food production** must stay ahead of consumption
2. **Unrest management** via Theater is essential
3. **Gold accumulation** enables flexibility
4. **Army maintenance** costs scale significantly
5. **Critical failures** are manageable with preparation

### System Balance Assessment
The standard rules with universal critical failure consequences (+1 Unrest) create appropriate tension without being punitive. The progression from struggling village to thriving metropolis feels earned and satisfying. The system rewards both careful planning and bold expansion.

## Conclusion

Simulation #005 demonstrates that the kingdom building system, when run with correct Pathfinder 2e rules, produces engaging and balanced gameplay. The progression curve from Level 4 to Level 15 creates distinct phases of play, each with unique challenges and opportunities. The universal unrest penalty for critical failures adds tension without creating unwinnable situations, as cultural buildings like Theaters provide viable counterplay.

The simulation achieved Exceptional Success, reaching Metropolis status by Turn 32 and maintaining prosperity through to Turn 50. This validates that the system's mathematical framework supports both challenge and achievement when players make strategic decisions.

**Most Valuable Lesson:** Success in kingdom building requires balancing immediate needs (food, unrest) with long-term investments (structures, expansion), while being prepared to handle the inevitable critical failures that will occur.
