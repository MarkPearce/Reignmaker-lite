- Territory: 22 hexes
- Gold: 52
- Armies: 4
- Final Unrest: 7 (Tier 2: Turmoil)

## Growth Trajectory
- **Early Game (Turns 1-10):** Village to Town Level 4 - Slower start without fifth action
- **Expansion Phase (Turns 11-20):** City achieved Turn 13, reached 14 hexes
- **Consolidation (Turns 21-30):** Built stability infrastructure
- **Crisis Management (Turns 31-40):** Metropolis achieved, handled Tier 2 incidents
- **Final Challenge (Turns 41-50):** Survived major incidents despite limited actions

## Unrest Management
- Maximum Unrest: 8 (Turn 46, after Prison Break)
- Incidents Faced: 21 total
  - Minor: 9
  - Moderate: 9  
  - Major: 3
- Crisis Points: Tier changes at Turns 5, 32, 46
- Average Unrest: 4.1 (well-controlled despite fewer actions)

## Critical Moments

### Game-Changing Successes
1. **Turn 4:** Trade critical success provided 6 Food for 5 Gold, preventing collapse
2. **Turn 13:** Critical success jumped Town directly to City (+1 Fame)
3. **Turn 50:** Final diplomacy critical prevented total collapse

### Major Setbacks
1. **Turn 8:** Critical failure damaged Granary during development
2. **Turn 46:** Prison Break released all imprisoned unrest
3. **Turn 18:** Emigration Threat permanently lost a worksite

## Key Turning Points
1. **Turn 4:** Trade critical saved kingdom from early food crisis
2. **Turn 13:** City achievement unlocked vital structure slots
3. **Turn 32:** Metropolis reached despite rising unrest
4. **Turn 29:** Arrest Dissidents prevented unrest spiral
5. **Turn 46:** Prison Break created maximum crisis

## Strategic Insights
- **What Worked:** Early trade success, fast City advancement, Theater for passive unrest reduction, diplomatic structures
- **Challenges:** Only 4 actions per turn, early food crisis with Town, territory passive unrest, fewer actions for incidents
- **Sweet Spot:** 7-10 hexes with Town/early City provided best stability with limited actions

## Impact of No Companions
- **20% Action Loss:** 4 actions instead of 5 significantly reduced flexibility
- **Harder Prioritization:** Every action counted more, mistakes were costlier
- **Incident Pressure:** Less ability to both handle incidents AND grow
- **Required Earlier Stability:** Theater and unrest management more critical
- **Still Winnable:** Standard Success achieved despite handicap

## Final Assessment
The simulation achieved Standard Success without Companion actions, proving the system remains balanced but noticeably more challenging. The kingdom grew from a village to a Metropolis controlling 22 hexes while managing 21 incidents with only 4 actions per turn. The reduced action economy forced tighter strategic planning, earlier investment in stability infrastructure, and more conservative expansion. The game remains engaging and winnable without Companions, but requires more careful resource management and risk assessment.
