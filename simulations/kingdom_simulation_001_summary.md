## Growth Trajectory
```
Turns 1-10:  Village → City (explosive growth)
Turns 11-20: City → Metropolis (peak power)
Turns 21-30: Consolidation phase

- **Average Unrest:** 0.8 across all turns

## Critical Moments

### Game-Changing Successes
- **Turn 7:** Settlement jumped 2 levels (Town 2→4)
- **Turn 15:** Dragon slain! (+5 Fame, +20 Gold, special hex)
- **Turn 17:** Jumped to Metropolis status
- **Turn 18:** Trade network established (+10 Gold/turn)

### Major Setbacks
- **Turn 11:** Disease outbreak + construction accident (Unrest spike to 3)
- **Turn 44:** Market crash (lost significant gold reserves)

## Key Turning Points
1. **Turn 4:** Became Town - unlocked advanced buildings
2. **Turn 11:** Master proficiency unlocked - success rates jumped from ~60% to ~75%
3. **Turn 15:** Dragon victory transformed the kingdom
4. **Turn 17:** Achieved Metropolis status (peak of power)

## Strategic Insights
- **What Worked:** Early infrastructure focus, Theater/Arena for unrest control, economic building chains
- **Challenges:** Food storage caps, late-game DC scaling (Level 13+)
- **Sweet Spot:** City Level 5-6 with 20-25 hexes proved most sustainable

## Final Assessment
The kingdom followed a classic rise-and-plateau pattern. Strong early infrastructure and the Level 7 proficiency breakthrough enabled rapid mid-game expansion. The dragon victory at Turn 15 was the defining moment. Late-game proved challenging with higher DCs, suggesting the system may need adjustment for Levels 13-15.

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✓ City status achieved
- ✓ 20+ hexes controlled  
- ✓ Multiple major conflicts won
- ✓ Unrest managed effectively
- ✓ Positive gold balance maintained
