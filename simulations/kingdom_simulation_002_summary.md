# Kingdom Simulation #002 - Summary

**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Result:** Standard Success

## Quick Stats
- Final Settlement: Metropolis Level 10
- Territory: 29 hexes
- Gold: 127
- Armies: 4

## Growth Trajectory
- **Turn 1-5:** Struggle phase - difficulty establishing first worksite
- **Turn 6:** Breakthrough - Town achieved, first army recruited
- **Turn 7-20:** Steady expansion with crisis management
- **Turn 21:** City achieved (critical success)
- **Turn 23:** Master proficiency unlocked - expansion accelerates
- **Turn 41:** Metropolis achieved
- **Turn 50:** Economic powerhouse established

## Unrest Management
- Maximum Unrest: 4 (Turn 13)
- Crisis/Rebellion Thresholds: Never crossed rebellion threshold (5+)
- Average Unrest: ~2.3
- Key stability structures: Theater (Turn 4), Cathedral (Turn 32)

## Critical Moments
### Game-Changing Successes
1. **Turn 4:** Double critical success - Farm finally established + Theater built for half cost
2. **Turn 6:** Critical success upgrade to Town + natural 20 on Lumbermill
3. **Turn 21:** PC2 natural 20 - Early City upgrade
4. **Turn 41:** PC4 natural 20 - Metropolis achieved

### Major Setbacks
1. **Turns 1-3:** Multiple failed attempts to create first farm
2. **Turn 13:** Event cascade with multiple failures creating Unrest spike
3. **Turn 34:** Near-rebellion crisis requiring immediate attention

## Key Turning Points
1. **Turn 4:** First successful worksite after multiple failures - momentum shift
2. **Turn 7 (Level 7):** Master proficiency unlocked - 2 hexes per claim action
3. **Turn 21:** City status achieved earlier than expected
4. **Turn 26:** Infrastructure boom with multiple critical successes
5. **Turn 41:** Metropolis threshold crossed

## Strategic Insights
- **What Worked:** 
  - Early investment in stability structures (Granary, Theater)
  - Quick crisis response prevented unrest spirals
  - Leveraging Master proficiency for rapid mid-game expansion
  - Balanced development between structures, worksites, and territory

- **Challenges:** 
  - Initial worksite establishment required many attempts
  - Food management with armies required careful attention
  - Mid-game plateau (Levels 8-10) slower than early/late game
  - Event RNG could create sudden crisis points

- **Sweet Spot:** 
  - Level 7+ with Master proficiency enables reliable 2-hex expansion
  - Theater + Cathedral combination keeps unrest manageable
  - 3-4 armies optimal for defense without food strain

## Final Assessment
Simulation #002 successfully demonstrates the updated kingdom rules create engaging gameplay with meaningful progression milestones. The system maintained tension throughout while allowing recovery from setbacks. Critical successes at key moments prevented failure spirals, while the scaling DC system kept challenges appropriate to party level. The simulation achieved Standard Success with a thriving Metropolis, substantial territory, and strong economic position, validating the rules revisions work as intended.
