# Kingdom Simulation #006 - Summary

**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Result:** STANDARD SUCCESS (barely)

## Quick Stats
- Final Settlement: Metropolis Level 9
- Territory: 24 hexes (expansion halted due to unrest)
- Gold: 67
- Armies: 2 (minimal due to stability focus)
- **Average Unrest: 4.2** (vs 0.8 in Sim #005)

## New Unrest System
- **Hex-based:** +1 Unrest per 8 hexes controlled (per turn)
- **Metropolis:** +1 additional Unrest per turn
- **Culture buildings:** Only provide bonuses to checks (except Auditorium -1/turn)

## Growth Trajectory

### Early Phase (Turns 1-10, Levels 4-6)
- **Turn 4:** Town achieved, 9 hexes triggers passive unrest
- **Turn 5:** First justice infrastructure (Stocks)
- **Turn 9:** Amphitheater built for +2 to unrest checks
- **Turn 10:** Constant +1/turn unrest pressure established

### Mid Phase (Turns 11-30, Levels 7-10)
- **Turn 14:** Hit 16 hexes - unrest jumps to +2/turn
- **Turn 15-16:** Crisis mode, Prison built for mass arrests
- **Turn 24:** Hit 24 hexes - unrest jumps to +3/turn!
- **Turn 25-28:** Emergency measures, festivals, executions
- **Turn 28:** Decision to halt expansion at 24 hexes

### Late Phase (Turns 31-50, Levels 11-15)
- **Turn 32:** Metropolis achieved - unrest now +4/turn total!
- **Turn 33:** Unrest peaks at 8 (near rebellion)
- **Turn 36:** Auditorium built for partial relief (net +3/turn)
- **Turn 42:** Donjon built for maximum imprisonment
- **Turn 44:** Golden Age impossible due to high unrest
- **Turn 50:** End with Unrest 3, imprisoned 7/8

## Unrest Management Actions

**Total: 49 unrest-related actions out of 250 (20% of all actions!)**
- Deal with Unrest: 23 times
- Arrest Dissidents: 12 times
- Execute Prisoners: 8 times
- Festivals: 6 times (30 Gold spent)

Compare to Simulation #005: Only 3 unrest actions total

## Critical Moments

### Unrest Thresholds Hit
1. **Turn 9:** 8+ hexes = +1/turn begins
2. **Turn 14:** 16+ hexes = +2/turn
3. **Turn 24:** 24+ hexes = +3/turn
4. **Turn 32:** Metropolis adds +1 more = +4/turn total

### Crisis Points
- **Turn 15:** Unrest 4, emergency arrests needed
- **Turn 24:** Hit -1 penalty threshold (5+ unrest)
- **Turn 33:** Unrest 8, near rebellion
- **Turn 46:** Critical failure brings crisis return

## Key Turning Points

1. **Turn 5:** Building Stocks early proved essential
2. **Turn 14:** Crossing to +2/turn changed gameplay completely
3. **Turn 28:** Decision to halt expansion saved the kingdom
4. **Turn 32:** Metropolis achievement nearly caused collapse
5. **Turn 36:** Auditorium provided crucial but insufficient relief

## Strategic Insights

### What Worked
- **Early Justice Infrastructure:** Stocks on Turn 5 vital
- **Culture Buildings:** Amphitheater's +2 bonus essential
- **Expansion Cap:** Stopping at 24 hexes prevented +4 passive
- **Imprisonment Strategy:** Constantly converting to imprisoned unrest
- **Auditorium Rush:** Only thing keeping Metropolis viable

### What Failed
- **Normal Growth:** Impossible with unrest pressure
- **Military Development:** Only 2 armies due to stability focus
- **Economic Development:** Gold spent on festivals
- **30+ Hex Goal:** Would have meant +4 base unrest
- **Golden Age:** Never achieved due to persistent unrest

### System Impact
The enhanced unrest system fundamentally changed gameplay:
- **Expansion has real costs** via unrest thresholds
- **Metropolis is a burden** not just an achievement
- **Imprisonment is essential** not optional
- **Action economy dominated** by stability management
- **Strategic variety limited** by constant crisis

## Final Assessment

The hex-based unrest system (+1 per 8 hexes) combined with Metropolis penalty successfully makes unrest management the central gameplay challenge. The kingdom achieved Standard Success but was forced to abandon normal development patterns.

The system achieves its goals:
- Unrest is now meaningful (average 4.2 vs 0.8)
- Imprisonment mechanics are vital
- Expansion requires careful consideration
- No more "Theater and forget" strategy

However, it may be slightly overtuned:
- Metropolis with 24+ hexes (+4/turn) is nearly unmanageable
- 20% of all actions spent on unrest feels excessive
- Little room for other strategic choices
- Some achievements (Golden Age) become impossible

## Comparison to Previous Simulations

| Metric | Sim #005 (Standard) | Sim #006 (Enhanced) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Average Unrest | 0.8 | 4.2 |
| Unrest Actions | 3 | 49 |
| Max Hexes | 32 | 24 |
| Final Gold | 187 | 67 |
| Final Armies | 5 | 2 |
| Success Level | Exceptional | Standard |

## Recommendation

The system successfully makes unrest relevant but may benefit from slight adjustments:
- Consider +1 per 10 hexes instead of 8
- Or remove the Metropolis penalty
- Or make Auditorium -2/turn instead of -1
- This would maintain tension while allowing more strategic variety
