# Kingdom Simulation #003 - Summary

**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Rule Variant:** Failures cause +1 Unrest, Critical Failures cause 1d4 Unrest
**Result:** KINGDOM COLLAPSE (Turn 11)

## Quick Stats
- Final Settlement: Village Level 1 (lost to rebellion)
- Territory: 5 hexes (at collapse)
- Gold: ~2
- Armies: 0 (never successfully recruited)
- **Kingdom Lifespan: 11 turns**

## Collapse Trajectory
- **Turn 1-3:** Initial struggles, Unrest 1-3
- **Turn 4:** First crisis point, Unrest 4
- **Turn 5-6:** Brief recovery, Unrest 0-1
- **Turn 7-8:** Catastrophic failures, Unrest spikes to 8
- **Turn 9:** Rebellion threshold crossed (Unrest 6)
- **Turn 10:** Death spiral begins (Unrest 5 with penalties)
- **Turn 11:** Total collapse (Unrest 12)

## Unrest Management - FAILURE
- Maximum Unrest: **12** (Turn 11)
- Crisis/Rebellion Thresholds: **Crossed Turn 9**
- Average Unrest: ~4.5
- Death Spiral: Once Unrest hit 5+, the -1 penalty made recovery impossible

## Critical Differences from Simulation #002

### Without Failure Consequences (#002):
- Maximum Unrest: 4
- Average Unrest: 2.3
- Result: **Metropolis Level 10**
- Gold: 127
- Territory: 29 hexes

### With Failure Consequences (#003):
- Maximum Unrest: 12
- Average Unrest: 4.5
- Result: **Kingdom Collapsed**
- Gold: ~2
- Territory: 5 hexes

## Key Failure Points
1. **Turn 1:** 3 of 5 actions failed → +3 Unrest immediately
2. **Turn 3:** Companions critical fail → +3 Unrest spike
3. **Turn 4:** PC4 critical fail on recruitment → +2 Unrest
4. **Turn 8:** Multiple critical failures → Unrest 8
5. **Turn 11:** Death spiral complete → Collapse

## Strategic Analysis

### Why It Failed:
- **Compound Penalties:** Each failure made the next action harder
- **No Recovery Window:** Constant Unrest generation overwhelmed mitigation
- **Critical Failure Spikes:** 1d4 Unrest could instantly create crisis
- **Death Spiral:** -1 penalty at Unrest 5+ made comeback impossible

### What This Reveals:
- **Current Rules Too Easy:** Without consequences, kingdoms succeed despite 60% failure rates
- **Proposed Rule Too Harsh:** Every failure causing Unrest creates unrecoverable spirals
- **Need Middle Ground:** Consequences should exist but not be universal

## Recommended Balance Point

Instead of all failures causing Unrest, consider:

### **Selective Consequences System:**
- **Military/Combat Failures:** +1 Unrest (people lose confidence)
- **Crisis Event Failures:** +1 Unrest (problems worsen)
- **Development Failures:** No immediate Unrest
- **Critical Failures:** +1 Unrest regardless of type
- **Natural 1:** +2 Unrest (catastrophic failure)

This would create ~30-40% of failures causing Unrest rather than 100%, providing meaningful consequences without guaranteed collapse.

## Final Assessment
The simulation proves that the current rules lack sufficient challenge, but adding universal failure consequences creates an impossibly punishing system. The game needs graduated consequences that create tension without making recovery impossible after a bad streak.
