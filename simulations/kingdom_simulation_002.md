### Success Level: **Standard Success**

## Key Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Early Structure Investment** - Granary and Theater provided crucial stability
2. **Critical Success Timing** - Natural 20s at key moments prevented spirals
3. **Master Proficiency Power** - Level 7 expansion capability was game-changing
4. **Crisis Management** - Quick response to unrest spikes prevented disasters

### Challenges Faced
1. **Early Worksite Struggles** - Many failed attempts before first farm
2. **Turn 13 Crisis** - Multiple failures created dangerous unrest spike
3. **Resource Balancing** - Food management with armies was tight
4. **Mid-Game Plateau** - Levels 8-10 had slower progression

### System Observations
1. **DC Scaling Works** - Progression felt challenging but fair
2. **Critical Results Matter** - Natural 20s and 1s create memorable moments
3. **Proficiency Tiers Clear** - Master at Level 7 is a major power spike
4. **Unrest System Balanced** - Threatening but manageable with attention

### Rules Working As Intended
- Kingdom level = party level creates smooth progression
- On-level DCs maintain consistent challenge
- Structure bonuses provide meaningful choices
- Event frequency (every 3-5 turns) feels right

## Conclusion

Simulation #002 demonstrates that the updated rules create a satisfying progression curve with meaningful decision points and recoverable crises. The system rewards both strategic planning and tactical crisis management while maintaining tension through the entire 50-turn span.
