# Kingdom Actions

## What Are Kingdom Actions?

Kingdom Actions represent the decisions and efforts your leaders make to guide the kingdom's development, respond to crises, and achieve strategic goals. Each turn, your 4 PCs each take one Kingdom Action, allowing you to shape the kingdom through construction, expansion, diplomacy, military operations, and more.

**How Actions Are Resolved:**
- Each action requires a skill check using a Level-based DC appropriate to your party's level
- Different skills can often be used for the same action, representing different approaches
- Success degrees (Critical Success, Success, Failure, Critical Failure) determine the outcome
- Some actions grant bonuses when performed from your Capital settlement

**The Aid Action:**
Instead of taking their own action, a PC can choose to Aid another PC's Kingdom Action. The aiding PC makes a skill check (DC 15+), and their degree of success provides bonuses to the assisted action. This allows strategic cooperation on crucial actions - see the Aid Another action below for complete details.

**Action Categories:**
This document organizes all Kingdom Actions into their thematic categories: Uphold Stability, Manage Armies, Expand the Borders, Urban Planning, Foreign Affairs, and General Economic Actions.

---

## Maintain Order
_Maintain the kingdom's cohesion by resolving crises, supporting allies, and quelling unrest before it can take root._

### Aid Another
_Support an ally's kingdom action through preparation and assistance, improving their chances of success._

**Requirements:**
- **Preparation:** You must declare you are preparing to Aid a specific PC's action at the start of the Kingdom Turn
- **Action Cost:** Preparing to Aid counts as your Kingdom Action for the turn
- **Proximity:** You must be working in the same region or settlement as the PC you're aiding

**How it Works:**
When your ally attempts their declared Kingdom Action:
1. You make a skill check using an appropriate skill for the action (DC 15, adjusted by GM for difficulty)
2. Your assistance modifies your ally's roll based on your degree of success

**Aid Check Results:**

| Degree of Success | Effect on Ally's Check |
| --- | --- |
| Critical Success | +2/+3/+4 circumstance bonus (based on proficiency*) + aided PC rolls twice takes highest result |
| Success | +2/+3/+4 circumstance bonus (based on proficiency*) |
| Failure | +1 circumstance bonus |
| Critical Failure | -1 circumstance penalty |

*Proficiency bonuses:

- **Trained or Expert:** +2 bonus
- **Master:** +3 bonus
- **Legendary:** +4 bonus

**Limitations:**

- **Declaration Required:** Both the helper and the helped must declare their intentions at the start of the turn

**Example:** PC1 (Master in Engineering Lore) declares they will Aid PC2's "Build Roads" action

- PC1 rolls Engineering Lore to Aid: 1d20+12 vs DC 15 = Success
- PC2 gets +3 circumstance bonus to their Build Roads check (Master proficiency)
- PC2 attempts Build Roads with the +3 bonus
- If PC3 also wanted to Aid the same action, they would roll vs DC 20

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Even failed Aid attempts provide a +1 bonus, making it rarely a wasted action
- Higher proficiency characters provide significantly better bonuses
- Critical success provides valuable insurance against failure on crucial checks
- Consider the importance of the action being aided vs. taking independent actions
