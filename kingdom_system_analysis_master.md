# Kingdom System Analysis - Master Document

## Overview
This document aggregates and analyzes results from multiple kingdom simulations for the Pathfinder 2E Reignmaker-lite subsystem. Each simulation follows the Kingdom_Simulation_Runner.md guidelines with unique randomization to test system balance and consistency.

## Simulation Index
- **Simulation #001:** September 14, 2025
  - Result: Standard Success (City Level 6, 24 hexes, 73 gold)
  - Seed: 20250914-145900
  - Key finding: Strong early growth that plateaued in later turns

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### 1. Kingdom Level = Party Level
The kingdom level advances in lockstep with party level. This represents the PCs' growing expertise as leaders and the kingdom's increasing sophistication.

### 2. All Actions Use On-Level DCs
**Every kingdom action uses the On-Level DC from the skill progression table:**
- Level 4: DC 19
- Level 7: DC 23  
- Level 10: DC 27
- Level 15: DC 34

**There are no fixed DCs** - everything scales with kingdom/party level.

### 3. Skill Proficiency Distribution
- 2 PCs always have the highest available proficiency
- 2 PCs always have the second-highest available proficiency
- Proficiency unlocks: Expert (L3), Master (L7), Legendary (L15)

### 4. Actual d20 Rolls Required
Using flat averages or success percentages alone misses critical successes and failures, which are essential for:
- Narrative drama
- Risk/reward decisions
- Mechanical benefits/penalties

## Success Rate Analysis

### Expected vs Observed Success Rates

**Level 4 (Turns 1-4):**
- Expected: 57.5% average (65% Expert, 50% Trained)
- Observed: 65% average
- Critical Successes: 3 (major benefits)
- Critical Failures: 2 (created challenges)

**Level 7 (Turns 11-15):**
- Expected: 70% average (75% Master, 65% Expert)
- Observed: 80% average
- Master proficiency transformed success rates

**Level 15 (Turns 46-50):**
- Expected: 75% average (80% Legendary, 70% Master)
- Observed: 90% average
- Legendary PCs rarely failed

The slight overperformance was due to the specific d20 sequence used, but within reasonable variance.

## Critical Results Impact

### Critical Successes (8 total in simulation)
**Major Benefits Provided:**
- Territory expansion (Turn 2: 2 hexes claimed)
- Settlement development (Turn 7: Town jumps to Level 4)
- Military advantages (Turn 5: Bonus army with barracks)
- Dragon slaying (Turn 15: +5 Fame, +20 Gold)
- Arena construction (Turn 13: Grand Arena with bonuses)
- Trade network (Turn 18: +10 Gold/turn)

### Critical Failures (4 total in simulation)
**Complications Created:**
- Development failure (Turn 6: +2 Unrest)
- Construction accident (Turn 11: +2 Unrest)
- Exploration failure (Turn 26: mentioned in summary)
- Economic crisis (Turn 44: Market crash)

**These swings created memorable narrative moments and prevented the simulation from feeling mechanical.**

---

## Key Mechanical Insights

### 1. Territory Expansion Works Perfectly
With On-Level DCs:
- Early game (L4): DC 19 vs Expert +11 = 65% success
- Mid game (L7): DC 23 vs Master +17 = 75% success
- Late game (L15): DC 34 vs Legendary +29 = 80% success

Expansion remains viable throughout while still providing challenge.

### 2. Proficiency Progression Feels Rewarding
- **Expert (L3-6):** Competent but struggling
- **Master (L7-14):** Game-changing improvement
- **Legendary (L15+):** True mastery

The jump to Master at Level 7 is particularly impactful.

### 3. Economic Synergies Emerge
Successful builds discovered:
- Trade Bazaar + Merchant Guildhall + Royal Bank = exponential wealth
- Strategic Reserves + Citadel = crisis immunity
- Theater + cultural structures = unrest management

### 4. Coordinated Actions Remain Vital
Used strategically for:
- Settlement development (multiple successes)
- Crisis resolution
- Major construction projects

Not overused due to action economy constraints.

- ✅ Town status (achieved City)
- ✅ 15+ hexes (achieved 24)
- ✅ Unrest below 10 (average 0.8)
- ✅ No settlement loss
- ✅ Positive gold (73)

### Against Standard Success

## Strategic Recommendations for Players

### Early Game (Level 4-6)
- Focus on infrastructure (Granary, Market, Storehouse)
- Claim adjacent hexes while DCs are manageable
- Build diverse worksites
- Use Coordinated Effort for critical developments

### Mid Game (Level 7-10)
- Leverage Master proficiency for expansion
- Build economic structures (Trade Bazaar, Counting House)
- Establish military presence
- Develop to City status

### Late Game (Level 11-15)
- Focus on high-tier structures
- Maximize economic engines
- Prepare for endgame challenges
- Push for Metropolis

### Skill Specialization
- 2 PCs should rush Master in different skills
- Industry and Economy are particularly powerful
- Stability becomes critical for unrest management
- Warfare needed for late-game conflicts

## Common Implementation Errors to Avoid

### 1. Using Fixed DCs
❌ "Claim Hex is always DC 14"
✅ Use On-Level DC from table

### 2. Ignoring Critical Results
❌ Using only success percentages
✅ Roll actual d20s for full outcome range

### 3. Wrong Proficiency Distribution
❌ All PCs at same proficiency
✅ 2 at highest, 2 at second-highest

### 4. Separating Kingdom and Party Level
❌ Tracking separate progression
✅ They advance together

---

## Patterns & Insights

### Consistent Success Factors (from simulations)
1. **Early Infrastructure** - Farmsteads and Granaries prevent food crises
2. **Critical Successes on Development** - Can jump settlement levels
3. **Theater/Arena for Unrest** - Consistent reduction prevents spirals
4. **Economic Development Chain** - Marketplace → Grand Market → Trade Networks

### Common Challenges
1. **Turn 11 Disease Event** - Difficult even with preparation
2. **Storage Caps** - Repeatedly hit limits until more Granaries
3. **Level 13-15 Progression** - DCs become very challenging
4. **Late Game Stagnation** - Growth plateaus after Level 12

### Strategic Recommendations
- Rush to Master proficiency in key skills
- Prioritize Storehouse for resource management
- Use Fame strategically for critical rolls
- Build economic structures in sequence for synergy

## System Balance Assessment

Based on current simulations, the system shows:

### Working Well ✅
- Settlement progression pace
- Critical success/failure impact
- Economic growth curves
- Proficiency progression value

### Needs More Data 🔄
- Military combat variance
- Event difficulty spread
- Different starting terrain impact
- Alternative strategies viability

### Potential Issues ⚠️
- Late game progression (Levels 13-15) may need DC adjustment
- Settlement growth plateaus after reaching City status
- Final hex count below target despite strong early growth

---

## Next Simulations Needed

To fully validate system balance, we need:
1. **Different Seeds:** 3-5 more runs with unique randomization
2. **Strategy Variations:** Military-focused, diplomatic, economic
3. **Stress Tests:** High unrest scenarios, resource scarcity
4. **Starting Variations:** Different terrain configurations
