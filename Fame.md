# Fame

Fame represents your kingdom's reputation and notable achievements. It provides a mechanical benefit through rerolls and serves as a measure of your realm's growing influence.

## Gaining Fame

**Automatic Fame:**
- **Start of Turn:** Gain 1 Fame at the beginning of each Kingdom Turn (Phase 1)

**Earned Fame:**
- **Critical Success:** Gain 1 Fame when rolling a critical success on any kingdom action
- **Event Rewards:** Certain events grant Fame as a reward:
  - Archaeological Find (Critical Success)
  - Discovery (Critical Success)
  - Magical Discovery (Success option)
  - Pilgrimage (Critical Success)
  - Other events as specified

## Using Fame

**Reroll Kingdom Checks:**
- **Cost:** Spend 1 Fame to reroll any kingdom check
- **Timing:** Must decide to use Fame immediately after seeing the initial roll result
- **Limitation:** Can only reroll once per check (cannot spend multiple Fame on the same roll)
- **Must Take New Result:** You must use the second roll, even if it's worse

## Fame Storage

- Fame does not carry over between Kingdom Turns unless specifically noted
- There is no maximum Fame limit during a turn
- Unspent Fame is lost at the end of each Kingdom Turn

## Example Fame Usage

Your kingdom attempts to Deal with Unrest using Diplomacy:
1. Initial roll: Total of 8 (Failure)
2. Spend 1 Fame to reroll
3. New roll: Total of 15 (Success)
4. Must use the new result

This represents your kingdom leveraging its reputation and past achievements to overcome a difficult situation.
