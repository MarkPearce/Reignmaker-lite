# Diplomatic Relations

Diplomatic relations represent your kingdom's standing with neighbouring realms, powerful factions, and influential organizations. These relationships directly impact trade opportunities, military alliances, and the overall stability of your borders. Each diplomatic relationship is tracked using an attitude scale that mirrors personal attitudes but operates at the kingdom level.

## Attitude Levels

Each faction, neighbouring kingdom, or major organization has an attitude toward your kingdom:

| Attitude | Description | Effects |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Helpful** | Actively supports your kingdom's interests | • may provide military aid if attacked<br>• Offers favourable trade deals (-1 Gold on purchases (min 1))<br>• May gift resources or share intelligence<br>• Allows military passage through their territory |
| **Friendly** | generally positive relationship | • Open to trade agreements<br>• Will consider military alliances<br>• Shares basic information and warnings<br>• -1 DC to diplomatic checks with this faction |
| **Indifferent** | No strong feelings either way | • Standard trade rates apply<br>• May be swayed to either side<br>• Neutral in conflicts<br>• Base DC for all diplomatic interactions |
| **Unfriendly** | Suspicious or hostile to your interests | • Trade restrictions (+1 Gold tax  on all purchases)<br>• +2 DC to diplomatic checks<br>• May support your enemies<br>• Closed borders to your armies |
| **Hostile** | Actively opposes your kingdom | • No trade permitted<br>• May declare war or raid borders<br>• +4 DC to diplomatic checks<br>• Provides aid to your enemies<br>• +1 Unrest per turn while hostile neighbor exists |

## Diplomatic Capacity

Maintaining close diplomatic relationships requires dedicated diplomatic infrastructure. Your kingdom's capacity for sustaining **Helpful** relationships is determined by your diplomatic structures:

**Calculating Capacity:**
- **No diplomatic structures:** 0 Helpful relationships (can still have Friendly or lower)
- **Sum all diplomatic structures in your kingdom:**
  - **Embassy (T2):** +1 Helpful relationship capacity
  - **Grand Embassy (T3):** +2 Helpful relationship capacity  
  - **Diplomatic Quarter (T4):** +3 Helpful relationship capacity

**Examples:**
- 2 Embassies = 2 Helpful relationships
- 1 Grand Embassy + 1 Embassy = 3 Helpful relationships
- 1 Diplomatic Quarter + 2 Grand Embassies = 7 Helpful relationships

**Exceeding Capacity:**
- You can have unlimited Friendly, Indifferent, Unfriendly, or Hostile relationships
- If you gain more Helpful relationships than your capacity (through events or critical successes), you must choose which to maintain at the end of the Kingdom Turn
- Relationships not maintained automatically degrade to Friendly
- Without any diplomatic structures, you cannot maintain Helpful relationships at all (they degrade to Friendly)

This represents the diplomatic corps, translators, administrative staff, and ongoing attention required to maintain the closest alliances. A kingdom that invests heavily in diplomatic infrastructure can expand its sphere of influence significantly.

## Changing Attitudes

Diplomatic attitudes can be shifted through kingdom actions, events, and consequences of your decisions:

**Improving Relations:**
- **Send Diplomatic Envoy** action (uses Diplomacy skill)
  - Success: Improve attitude by one step
  - Critical Success: Improve by one step + gain 1 Fame or reduce 1 Unrest
  - Failure: No change
  - Critical Failure: Worsen attitude by one step
- **Offer Tribute** (costs Gold or Resources based on faction power)
- **Complete faction requests or quests**
- **Supporting them in conflicts**

**Worsening Relations:**
- **Failed diplomatic attempts** (critical failures)
- **Breaking treaties or agreements**
- **Supporting their enemies**
- **Aggressive expansion near their borders**
- **Certain event choices**

## Initial Attitudes

When first encountering a new faction or kingdom, their initial attitude is typically **Indifferent** unless:
- **Historical grievances:** May start Unfriendly or Hostile
- **Shared culture/religion:** May start Friendly
- **Reputation effects:** Your kingdom's Fame or Infamy affects starting attitudes
- **Event outcomes:** Discovery circumstances may set initial attitude

## Diplomatic Consequences

**Multiple Hostile Neighbors:**
- Each Hostile faction: +1 Unrest per turn
- Risk of coordinated attacks increases
- Trade routes may be completely cut off

**Alliance Networks:**
- Helpful allies may intervene in wars
- Friendly kingdoms provide circumstance bonuses to stability
- Connected friendly kingdoms reduce event severity

**Trade Implications:**
- Helpful: -1 Gold per trade resource (min 1)
- Friendly: Standard rates
- Indifferent: Standard rates
- Unfriendly: +1 Gold tax per trade resource
- Hostile: No trade possible
