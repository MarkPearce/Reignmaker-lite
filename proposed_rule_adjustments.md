# Proposed Kingdom Rule Adjustments - Quick Reference

## Problem: Limited Hex Expansion & Single Settlement Focus

### Solution 1: Scaled Claim Hex Action
**Current Rule:** Claim 1 hex (2 on critical success)

**Proposed Rule:** 
- **Expert/Trained:** Claim 1 hex (2 on critical success)
- **Master:** Claim 2 hexes (3 on critical success)
- **Legendary:** Claim 3 hexes (4 on critical success)
- **Bonus:** +2 when adjacent to 3+ controlled hexes

### Solution 2: Multiple Settlement Incentives
**Current Rule:** No mechanical benefit for multiple settlements

**Proposed Rule - Network Bonuses:**
- 2 settlements: +1 to all kingdom actions
- 3 settlements: +2 to all kingdom actions, +1 Fame/turn
- 4+ settlements: +3 to all kingdom actions, +2 Fame/turn

**Proposed Rule - Easier Establishment:**
- First settlement: Normal DC
- Second settlement: DC -2
- Third settlement: DC -4
- Fourth+ settlements: DC -6

### Solution 3: Adjusted DC Scaling (Levels 12-15)
**Current DCs:**
- Level 12: DC 30
- Level 13: DC 31
- Level 14: DC 32
- Level 15: DC 34

**Proposed DCs:**
- Level 12: DC 30
- Level 13: DC 30 (no increase)
- Level 14: DC 31
- Level 15: DC 32

### Solution 4: Settlement Specialization
**New Rule:** When a settlement reaches Town (Level 2), choose a specialization:
- **Military Outpost:** -1 Food cost per army, +2 warfare actions
- **Trade Hub:** +3 Gold/turn, +2 economy actions
- **Agricultural Center:** +4 Food/turn, +2 industry actions
- **Cultural Center:** -2 Unrest/turn, +2 stability actions

## Expected Impact

With these adjustments, a typical simulation should achieve:
- **30-35 hexes** by Turn 50 (vs 24 currently)
- **3-4 settlements** developed (vs 1 currently)
- **Metropolis** more achievable (currently very difficult)
- **Multiple viable strategies** (wide vs tall empires)

## Implementation Notes

These changes maintain the core system while addressing specific pain points:
1. Hex expansion becomes more efficient at higher levels
2. Multiple settlements provide tangible benefits
3. Late game DCs remain challenging but achievable
4. Strategic choices matter more

The ~65% base success rate should remain unchanged, but players can achieve more ambitious goals through smart play and utilizing the new bonuses effectively.
