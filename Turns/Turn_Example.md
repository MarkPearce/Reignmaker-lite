# Example Kingdom Turn

**Kingdom:** 1 Town (Level 3, needs 4 Food)

**Controlled hexes:**

- 2x Plains with Farmsteads = 4 Food
- 1x Forest with Logging Camp = 2 Lumber
- 1x Hills with Quarry = 1 Stone
- Total: 4 hexes (no territory unrest)

## Turn Sequence:

**Phase 1 – Status Phase:**

- **Gain Fame:** Gain 1 Fame automatically
- Current Fame: 1 (can spend to reroll kingdom checks)
- **Apply Permanent Modifiers:** No special structure bonuses active

**Phase 2 – Resource Phase:**

- **Production:** Collect resources from hexes
  - 2x Plains with Farmsteads = 4 Food
  - 1x Forest with Logging Camp = 2 Lumber
  - 1x Hills with Quarry = 1 Stone
- **Gold Income:** No income this turn (no commerce structures)
- **Current Resources:** 4 Food, 2 Lumber, 1 Stone, 3 Gold

**Phase 3 – Unrest & Incidents Phase:**

- **Calculate Unrest:**
  - Not at war (no unrest penalty)
  - Territory: 4 hexes (no passive unrest)
  - Current Unrest: 2
- **Unrest Tier:** Tier 0: Stable (0-2) - no penalty, no incident check needed
- No incident occurs

**Phase 4 – Events Phase:**

- Roll flat check DC 16: Rolled 18 (success)
- **Event: Bandit Activity** occurs in a random border hex
- **Event Details:**
  - Border hex bandits establish a camp and begin raiding travelers
  - This is a **Dangerous, Continuous** event
  - Skills available: Intimidation (crush with force), Diplomacy (negotiate surrender), Stealth (infiltrate and dismantle)
  - PC 2 will attempt to resolve this event during the Action Phase

**Phase 5 – Action Phase (4 PCs, 4 actions):**

- PC 1: **Develop Settlement** to add a Market Square (rolls success)
- PC 2: **Resolve Bandit Activity Event** using Intimidation (rolls success)
  - Bandits scattered and driven away; event ends with no negative effects
- PC 3: **Send Scouts** to explore eastern hex (rolls success)
- PC 4: **Build Worksite** (Farmstead) in explored hex (rolls failure)

**Phase 6 – Upkeep Phase:**

- **Food Consumption:** Town consumes 4 Food → balanced (no shortage/unrest)
- **Military Support:** 1 army active, Town supports 2 armies → no morale check needed
  - Army consumes 1 Food (included in consumption above)
- **Build Queue:** Building a Training Yard (costs 2 Lumber, 2 Stone total)
  - Apply 2 Lumber + 1 Stone this turn automatically
  - 1 Stone still needed to complete (will finish next turn)
- **Storage:** No Storehouses built → excess resources lost
  - Remaining: 0 Food (all consumed), 0 Lumber (used in construction), 0 Stone (used in construction)
  - Gold carries over: 3 Gold
- **End of Turn Resolution:**
  - Unrest remains at 2 (stable)
  - Bandit Activity event successfully resolved (no ongoing effects)
  - Training Yard will complete next turn when final Stone is produced
  - Event DC resets to 16 for next turn (event occurred this turn)

**Result:** Kingdom stable, construction progressing, Market Square added, bandit threat eliminated, eastern hex scouted, worksite attempt failed.
